# Jekyll-manifest.json
Output a manifest.json file from _config.yml settings.

Prompted to create this for present and future Jekyll projects after seeing [a link on adaction.com](https://adactio.com/links/9839) to 
this [Manifest Generator](http://brucelawson.github.io/manifest/) which then led me to find a good reason (article), [Installable Web Apps](https://dev.opera.com/articles/installable-web-apps/), for such thing.
